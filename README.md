Is It For Toddlers
==================

This is a very simple single-page app. You input a thing, and it tells you
whether that thing is for toddlers.

[Try it!](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shimon/isitfortoddlers/master/index.html)

By default, the thing is NOT for toddlers.

But if you hold down shift while hitting enter or clicking the button, that
thing IS for toddlers.

Original idea by Josh Ain, interactive form/yes/no version by Shimon
Rura. Released in the public domain.
